# MultiPlayer (draft in progress)

## Introduction

Extending the ChainBet protocol to cover bets involving multiple players adds another level of complexity.  The field of study known as [Multi Party Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) contains a number of avenues, but not all are suitable for our purpose.

The ideal solution has the following properties:

1. It does not allow cheating via collusion, even against an attacker controlling all adverseries.  
2. It protects an honest participant from losing money, even if a dishonest participant acts irrationally.

This protocol meets those 2 ideals, although it does have the cost of requiring a security deposit of a multiple (N) of the bet amount, where N is the number of participants.  It may be possible to create a different scheme that meets the ideals and has a lower security deposit, but at the cost of added complexity, time, and multiple rounds.  We will not explore such a scheme here.

## Multilock 

We draw our initial inspiration from a multilock idea originally proposed by Kumaresan and Bentov, which offers the principle of  jointly locking coins for fair exchange.  Their proposal calls for a protocol change, using the leaves of the Merkle root to get a different transaction ID even if the transaction is unsigned.  

However, a protocol change is not necessary for our purposes.  We can build our solution simply by applying the correct tiering of transactions and time locks.

| 32    | Bet Txn Id |\<host_opreturn_txn_id> |This is the bet id that is needed in case Alice or Bob(s) have multiple bets going.| 
| 8-88 | Participant Txn List  | \<participant txn list>| The 8 byte tail (least significant bits) of the participant_opreturn_txn_id of each participant other than Alice will be put into a list, sorted, and concatenated. |


## Phase 4: Sign Main Funding Transaction

| Bytes       | Name         | Hex Value | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|-----------------|

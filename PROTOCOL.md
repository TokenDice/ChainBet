# ChainBet - (working draft). see readme for version 1

## Abstract

ChainBet is a proposed Bitcoin Cash protocol to enable on-chain betting.  This initial proposal focuses on a simple coin flip bet, but the principles could be extrapolated to enable more elaborate configurations.  The protocol consists of 2 components: a commitment scheme to enable a trustless wager, and an on-chain messaging system to facilitate communication. 

## Motivation

Since paleolithic times, humans have engaged in games of chance, and probably always will.  Blockchain technology can increase the fairness, transparency, and safety of these activities.  The Bitcoin Cash ecosystem can gain more users and more transaction volume by providing a trustless gaming mechanism.

## Summary

To perform a trustless coinflip wager, Alice and Bob should each create secret values.  If the sum of the values is even, Alice wins the bet.  If the sum of the values is odd, Bob wins the bet.  Alice and Bob will use a cryptographic  scheme where both parties can lock in the bet and reveal their secrets fairly.

In addition, there is a messaging component of the protocol so that the parties do not have to send any extraneous communication through the internet.  They can use the blockchain for everything.  Moreover, multiple parties can participate and match themselves into coinflip betting pairs, thus creating a virtual casino that functions nearly entirely on the blockchain.  

An app will still be required on the user end to use the protocol, to send transactions from the users’ addresses.
 
# Commitment Scheme

## Overview

Alice and Bob begin by each creating secret values, and then creating a hash of those values which serve as cryptographic commitments.

The scheme is based on the parties funding a multisignature address and the principle that Bob has the responsibility to claim his winnings after learning Alice’s secret.  If he does not, Alice would be able to claim a win by default based on a time lock.  The default win would be necessary since Bob would be motivated to do nothing (keep his secret a secret) once he discovers he has lost the bet.

But there is a flaw: What compels Alice to reveal the secret, knowing she would be guaranteed to win by “time out” if she doesn’t reveal it?  Note that Alice’s secret can’t be part of the multisignature script because Bob would then know it before he has committed funds.  And there is no apparent way to allow Bob to cancel the script if Alice doesn’t share her secret since he could always claim it wasn’t shared if he sees a loss.

To solve this problem, we add some extra steps prior to the **funding transaction** which moves funds to the primary multiignature address.  Essentially, Alice and Bob jointly create a transaction using both of their inputs, with Alice's input coming from a script that requires revealing her secret.  Bob's signatures should be collected first, ensuring that Alice's secret is not revealed prior to Bob committing his funds.  

In addition, we will provide a means of preventing double spend attacks with the use of escrow addresses.

## Escrow Preparation

To prepare, Alice and Bob will each set up a temporary "escrow" address to be used as a holding place before creating the funding transaction.  Both escrow addreses will require both Alice's and Bob's signatures.  Each escrow address will also have its own emergency timelock option to retrieve the funds if one of the parties stops cooperating.

## Alice Escrow Address

The main purpose of Alice's escrow address is to reveal Alice's **Secret A** when spent.  It will require both Alice and Bob's signature plus the secret.  By requiring the secret, it reveals it to Bob, thus fulfilling that part of the commitment shceme.

Alternatively, Alice can retrieve the funds unilaterally after 8 confirmations in the situation when Bob abandonds the betting process.

**Script:**
 
OP_IF "8 blocks" 

    OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY <alicePubkey> 
    
OP_ELSE 

    OP_HASH160 <AliceCommitment> OP_EQUALVERIFY 
    
    OP_2 <alicePubkey> <bobPubkey> 
    
    OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG 
    
OP_ENDIF'''



## Bob Escrow Address

The main purpose of Bob's escrow address is to prevent Bob from double spending.  Once the funding transaction is created, Alice's secret will be revealed.  If Bob sees that he has a loss, he could theoretically attempt to double spend his input to the funding transaction, thereby invalidating it.  

By first moving the funds into escrow and requiring Alice's signature in addition to Bob's to spend, Bob cannot on his own attempt a doublespend.  

Of course, it is necessary for the transaction that funds the escrow account to have at least 1 confirmation before the funding transaction is attempted, because otherwise Bob could doublespend that, invalidating both itself and the child transaction (the funding transaction).

Alternatively, Bob can also retrieve his own funds unilaterally after 8 confirmations in the situation when Alice abandonds the betting process.

**Script:**

OP_IF "8 blocks" 

    OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY <bobPubkey> 
    
OP_ELSE 

    OP_2 <alicePubkey> <bobPubkey> 
    
    OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG 
    
OP_ENDIF

## Why Alice's Escrow Needs Bob's Signature

Bob's escrow requires Alice's signature for the simple reason that it prevents Bob from double spending his input to the funding transaction.  However, it is not immediately obvious why Alice should also have Bob's signature, since she is not the one with the easy double spend opportunity: Once the funding transaction happens, Alice's secret is revealed and if Bob won, he could simply avoid any double spend attacks by waiting for the funding transaction to get 1 confirmation before claiming the win.  

However, this is inefficient because it requires more confirmations.  Since funding Bob's escrow account already requires waiting for a confirmation, it makes sense to use that time to prevent Alice's funds from being double spent as well.  This renders it unnecessary for Bob to wait for an additional confirmation after the funding transaction is sent before claiming a win.   
  
## OP_RETURN Communication Messages

The ChainBet protocol operates through a series of phases.  Some phases require a communication message to be sent across the network.  This is accomplished by broadcasting a BCH trasnsaction that contains an OP_RETURN output.  

Each OP_RETURN transaction will be assumed to have outputs going back to the sender's originating address.  The output amount back to the sender will simply be the entire balance (for standard UTXOs) of the sender minus the txn fee.  This approach is simple and it minimizes the impacts to the UTXO set over time, making each OP_RETURN message like a sweep transaction.

The OP_RETURN payload uses this format:

<protocol_id><version_id><phase_value><various_phase_dependent_data> 

The protocol_id is a [standard Terab 4-byte prefix](https://github.com/Lokad/Terab/blob/master/spec/opreturn-prefix-guideline.md) with a value of **0x00424554** (ASCII equivalent of "BET"). The version_id is a one-byte value that can be used to upgrade the protocol in the future.  Currently, it shall be **0x01**.  protocol_id and version_id should be present in all OP_RETURN payloads but will be ommitted in the subsequent message detail descriptions.

**Note that NOT all phases of the protocol use an OP_RETURN message.  Some instead consist of an escrow or funding transaction.**

# Protocol Phases

## Phase 1: Bet Offer Announcement

Alice advertises to the network that she is hosting a bet for anyone to accept.  She will wait until someone responds to accept her bet.
 
NOTE: This unique identifier for this Bet will be the transaction id of the txn containing this OP_RETURN Message #1, herein referred to as <host_opreturn_txn_id>.


OP_RETURN OUTPUT:

| Bytes       | Name         | Hex Value | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|-----------------|
| 1      | Phase | 0x01  | Phase 1 is "Bet Offer Announcement" |
| 1     | Bet Type | 0x01 | Denotes what kind of bet will be contructed. 0x01 for Coin flip. |
| 8     | Amount   | \<amount> | Bet amount in Satohis for each participant. | 
| 20 | Target Address | \<target> | Optional.  Restricts offer to a specific bet participant. |

 
## Phase 2: Bet Participant Acceptance

After Bob detects Alice’s Phase 1 message, Bob responds to Alice’s bet announcement letting Alice know that he accepts her bet.  (there may have been others on the network whom also accept the bet, but Bob happens to be the first to accept her bet)
 
NOTE: This transaction ID of the transaction containing this Message #2, herein referred to as the <participant_opreturn_txn_id>.

OP_RETURN OUTPUT:

| Bytes       | Name         | Hex Value | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|-----------------| 
| 1      | Phase | 0x02  | Phase 2 is " Bet Participant Acceptance" |
| 1     | Bet Txn Id |\<host_opreturn_txn_id> | This lets Alice know Bob wants to bet. |
| 65    | Bob Multi-sig Pub Key  | \<bobPubKey>| This is the public key that Alice should use when creating her p2sh input for the bet. |
 

## Phase 3: Bet Host Funding

Alice detects Bob's Phase 2 message.  She then prepares her escrow address and funds it.  Then she sends this announcement to Bob, indicating acceptance of the bet with Bob (thus others whom also accepted Alice's original announcement will know that they are being ignored and should look for other bets).

OP_RETURN OUTPUT:

| Bytes       | Name         | Hex Value | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|-----------------| 
| 1      | Phase | 0x03  | Phase 3 is " Bet Host Funding" |
| 32    | Bet Txn Id |\<host_opreturn_txn_id> |This is the bet id that is needed in case Alice or Bob have multiple bets going.|
| 32  | Participant Txn Id   | \<participant_opreturn_txn_id>| This is Alice's acknowledgement that Bob is the participant. |
| 65 | Host P2SH txid | \<host_p2sh_txid> | (Alice Escrow Address). Bob needs this, so he can verify the Bet Host has committed her funds to the bet, and the bet is real. Bob will also need this so he can also see what Alice’s committed value is once she tries to spend the final bet. |
| 32 | Host Multi-sig Pub Key | \<AlicePubKey> | Bob needs this so he can construct his own P2SH (multisig) input. Bob also needs this so he can deterministically compute the Host's P2SH (multisig with value commitment). |

## Phase 4: Bet Participant Funding

After Bob detects the Phase 3 message from Alice, he will know that he is in fact the bet participant. He can first check that Alice created her P2SH address with the correct amount so he knows the bet is real.

Bob can then create his own (escrow) P2SH address which will be used as an input to the main funding transaction.  Bob announces that he has submitted his P2SH to cover his side of the bet and passes the signatures for both P2SH addresses to Alice.

Once Bob verifies that Alice's P2SH has been submitted to the network he may wait for confirmations if he wants.  He must monitor the spending of Alice’s P2SH addresses in order to see Alice’s secret value.  If he doesn’t monitor spending of Alice’s P2SH input then he will not be able to try to claim a potential win.

 

 

This message allows Alice to tell Bob she is proceeding with the wager, and the P2SH of the address she has created in accordance with the commitment scheme.  Bob should deterministically verify this address.

## Phase 4: Bob signing

This message allows Bob to pass to Alice the signature needed for the funding transaction, in accordance with the commitment scheme.

## Phase 5: Bob resignation

If Bob realizes he lost the bet, he can message Alice to allow her to quickly claim her winnings.  If Bob loses but does not send this message, Alice will eventually claim the winnings using the timeout.

Note: After phase 4, no more special communication messages are required.  At this point, Alice will have received Bob’s signature and she can fully construct and broadcast the funding transaction, revealing her secret.  Bob will then claim the funds if he wins.  If he does not claim a win within the allotted time, Alice will claim the funds by default.  

Optionally (but recommended), Bob can be a gracious loser and send a resignation message revealing his secret to Alice, enhancing the user experience.

# Use of Modulus to Reduce Collisions

Finding partners to wager is handled with the nonce.  In the case when protocol usage is modest, an Alice can send an announcement message with an even numbered nonce and a Bob can join with a corresponding (incremented) odd numbered nonce.

**In the basic usage, Alice is always assumed to be even, and the Alice nonce must always be 1 less than the Bob nonce.  (10 , 11) is valid but (11, 12) is invalid.**

If usage were to accelerate, this system would break down because of multiple participants frequently using the same nonces.

For this, we can use the Modulus field.  With a value below 3, the optional functionality is ignored.  For values 3 or higher, we use a different scheme:  Given the Modulus field **m** and nonce **n**, n  should be matched with the next highest number **v**  where n mod m = v nod m.

For example, if Modulus field is 3, then nonce 12 Alice should be paired with nonce 15 Bob, 13 pairs with 16, and so on. For Modulus field 4, nonce 12 pairs to 16, 13 pairs to 17, etc.

The general idea is that when participants are being added quickly, they should “space themselves out”.  More thought should be put into the details of how this would be implemented in practice.

# Implementation Considerations

Here is a (probably incomplete) list of thoughts and considerations:

1. Applications implementing the protocol need to look at the mempool to read the announcements.  Mempool alone (rather than going back to prior blocks) should be sufficient to find players once the protocol has some usage.

2. The highest nonce should normally be used but there needs to be logic to handle gaps in the situation when a bad actor makes a large jump.

3. Note that the use of a separate “acceptance” step can eliminate collisions.

4. When Modulus > 3 , the lower number is always assumed to be Alice.  

5. Alice always wins the bet on “even” (regardless of nonce)

6. Direct messages between participants  make blockchain scanning minimal.


7. In the case Bob disappears after Alice creates the funding address A1, she can probably still use the address in the next round.

8. Participants need to check for double spends.

9. Some data passed between participants is redundant (for example the secret hash value is passed in the funding round, but it makes implementation easier and also supports simultaneous bets with the same partners.  Things can be made more efficient in future versions.

10. Messaging address public keys will be assumed for the smart contract.

11. In the case that Alice doesn’t publish the transaction in a timely manner following Bob’s signing, Bob should sweep the funds back soon to reclaim them and  so he doesn’t have to worry about keeping his application online.  

12. Participants need to be online generally.

13. It is important that Bob can deterministically generate that which he needs.  We assume the current blockheight is used in reference to the timelocks.

14. The bet amounts need to match (obviously)

15.  The secret values chosen must be large enough to avoid rainbow table attacks.

16. optional double spend

17. op return output vs regular output

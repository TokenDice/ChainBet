# ChainBet
 
ChainBet is a proposed Bitcoin Cash protocol to enable on-chain betting.  This initial proposal focuses on a simple coin flip bet, but the principles could be extrapolated to enable more elaborate configurations.  The protocol consists of 2 components: a commitment scheme to enable a trustless wager, and an on-chain messaging system to facilitate communication.
